# Water.me

Building AI course project


## Summary

A automated watering machine with use of image proccessing that can sense if the plant is dehydrated or not. This system will be a great use for the working people in the office or when travelling we dont need to worry about wattering the plant.

## Background

The idea is to make sure the plant is well hydrated even we're not at home. Sometimes our plants need the basic things but we are not around using this will be a great thing for us.


## How is it used?

Water.me can be use in all kinds of plants. We can use it in our small garden to maintain it, to our indoor plants, and outdoor. Wherever we need rehydration for a plant.


## Data sources and AI methods

It will use a data of plants, where the criteria varies depends on the plants. A plenty of high-quality data should be available in this kind of program.


## Challenges

Water.me does not have an ability to identify the plant it self. the user needs to input the plants name and where are them currently.


## What next?

There is unlimited amount of possible applications by adding features. It is, however, to be noted that legislation may set some restrictions for the features.
